# Deployment Guide

## Local Development

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
```

2. Set environment variables:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

3. Start the application:
```bash
./start_chatbot.sh
```

## Docker Deployment

Build and run with Docker:
```bash
docker build -t shopilots-chatbot .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key" shopilots-chatbot
```

## Heroku Deployment

1. Install Heroku CLI
2. Login: `heroku login`
3. Create app: `heroku create your-app-name`
4. Set environment variable: `heroku config:set OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"`
5. Push: `git push heroku main`

## Railway Deployment (Recommended)

1. Go to https://railway.app and sign in with GitHub
2. Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select `swastik-21/rag-chatbot` repository
4. Railway will automatically detect Python and deploy
5. In Railway dashboard, go to Variables tab and add:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` = your OpenAI API key
   - `PORT` = 8080 (optional, Railway auto-assigns)
6. Your app will be deployed automatically on every push to main branch

## Environment Variables

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Required for OpenAI API access

## Notes

- The vector database (`vector_store/`) is persisted locally
- For production, you may want to use a managed vector database service
- Ensure vector database is built before first deployment: `python chatbot/memory_builder.py`
